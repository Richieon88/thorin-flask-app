<h2>About Page</h2>
<p>
  The formation of the group grew out of a meeting Gandalf had with Thorin in
  Bree which kindled Thorin's interest in recapturing his long lost family
  inheritance. (Thorin's grandfather had been the King under the Mountain when
  Smaug came and took it.) Remembering that he had once known an adventurous
  Hobbit on his travels in the Shire, Gandalf decided to add Bilbo to their
  company because he knew that stealth and cunning were preferable to force.
  Gandalf also believed that someone like Bilbo could keep the sometimes
  prideful and stubborn Dwarves from rash action. The superstitious Dwarves also
  considered thirteen to be an unlucky number, and as Gandalf had planned to
  leave on other business, welcomed a fourteenth to fill into their party.

    <h3>Thorin Oakenshield</h3>
    <p>
      Thorin II was born in TA 2746 to the Dwarf prince Thráin II in the city of
      the Lonely Mountain. Early in his youth, Thorin and the other Dwarves of
      the Lonely Mountain were forced to flee by the dragon Smaug, in TA 2770.
      While in exile, he quickly grew into a capable warrior. This was
      demonstrated at the Battle of Azanulbizar, near Moria, in TA 2799. He
      fought with one of the Dwarven armies beneath Moria's East-gate, and at
      some point in the battle, his shield broke, and, using an oaken tree
      branch found on the ground as a shield, he gained the epithet
      "Oakenshield," which remained with him even in death.
